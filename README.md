This mod adds a progenitor mechanoid, capable of gestating and repairing other mechs. It's unlocked at ultra mechtech. A mechanitor is still needed to control the mechs but this can be avoided with the Gestalt Engine from Reinforced Mechanoids. The progenitor is not capable of making subcores I'm sorry bros I dont know why
